# BigData-HBase

#Limitations of Hadoop
Hadoop can perform only batch processing, and data will be accessed only in a sequential manner. That means one has to search the entire dataset even for the simplest of jobs. A huge dataset when processed results in another huge data set, which should also be processed sequentially. At this point, a new solution is needed to access any point of data in a single unit of time (random access).

#Hadoop Random Access Databases
Applications such as HBase, Cassandra, couchDB, Dynamo, and MongoDB are some of the databases that store huge amounts of data and access the data in a random manner.

#What is HBase?
HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of the Hadoop file system. It is an open-source project and is horizontally scalable. HBase is a data model that is similar to Googleâ€™s big table designed to provide quick random access to huge amounts of structured data. It leverages the fault tolerance provided by the Hadoop File System (HDFS). It is a part of the Hadoop ecosystem that provides random real-time read/write access to data in the Hadoop File System. One can store the data in HDFS either directly or through HBase. Data consumer reads/accesses the data in HDFS randomly using HBase. HBase sits on top of the Hadoop File System and provides read and write access.


#Features of HBase
HBase is linearly scalable.
It has automatic failure support.
It provides consistent read and writes.
It integrates with Hadoop, both as a source and a destination.
It has easy java API for client.
It provides data replication across clusters.

#Where to Use HBase
Apache HBase is used to have random, real-time read/write access to Big Data.
It hosts very large tables on top of clusters of commodity hardware.
Apache HBase is a non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable. Bigtable acts up on Google File System, likewise Apache HBase works on top of Hadoop and HDFS.

#Applications of HBase
It is used whenever there is a need to write heavy applications.
HBase is used whenever we need to provide fast random access to available data.
Companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Adobe use HBase internally.

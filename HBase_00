Note: 
Metadata of Hbase is stored in HDFS and actual data stored inside the region itself.
we can see stored data/tables at HDFS location at hbase directory--> hadoop fs -ls /hbase/data/default/
case sensitive syntax/keywords.
Row key can be unique.
The default versions is 1 and we can specify max as we wish:
(HBase does not overwrite row values, but rather stores different values per row by time (and qualifier). Excess versions are removed during major compactions.)

#Does HBase use Hadoop to store data or is a separate database independent of Hadoop?
The technical terms you used in the question are wrong.
HBase is in itself, a Hadoop database, which means it provides NoSQL based data storage (column-wise). Hadoop is a framework
Most importantly, HBase sits on top of Hadoop Distributed File System. (HDFS) That's where your data is.
